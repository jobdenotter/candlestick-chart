# React Candlestick component

You can use the components available in the components folder. They provide a zoomable candlestick chart based on Recharts. I have so far unsuccessfully tried to package this code. I intend to add zoom-out functionality, since at the moment you need a separate button for this.

Code currently does not work due to error

This is code for https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts-candlestick
